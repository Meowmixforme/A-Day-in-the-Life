# A Day in the Life

A Day in the Life is a university foundation year group project developed using Python. The game offers a narrative-driven experience that follows a day in the life of a university student, challenging players to solve a series of mini-games based on mathematical scenarios.

## Overview

The game simulates various situations a typical university student might encounter. As you progress through the day, you are presented with choices and mathematical mini-games that test your problem-solving skills in areas such as arithmetic, algebra, pattern recognition, and number base conversions.

Your performance in these mini-games affects your overall score and influences the course and outcome of your day.

## Features

- **Branching Narrative:** Make choices that affect the story and the mini-games you encounter.
- **Maths-Based Mini-Games:** Practice your skills in arithmetic, algebra, patterns, binary/decimal conversions, and more.
- **Score Tracking:** Your decisions and correct answers contribute to your final score and feedback.
- **Replayability:** Different choices lead to different challenges and endings.

## File Structure

- `A Day in the Life/ADayInthelifeMainGame.py` — The main game script, managing story flow and player choices.
- Individual mini-games (e.g., `MathsChallenge.py`, `pattern.py`, `Binaryeasy.py`, `Binaryhard.py`, etc.) — Each script contains a maths-based challenge.
- Other supporting scripts for additional mini-games and logic.
